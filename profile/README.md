The name of our organization comes from the first address of [BlockShop](https://blockshop.org/), 1712 N Street NW in Washington, DC. It was created to support blockchain projects with their software development and infrastructure needs. Over the years, we've grown it into a diverse community that helps personal projects and startups take off and mature. Besides providing free Team-tier access in GitHub, we also help with AWS, GCP, Google Workspace, Element, Adobe, and other set-ups, often free or at a reduced cost. We would like to thank all these companies for their continuous support and countless engineers who volunteer their time to help our projects succeed ðŸš€ðŸŒ•
